        <p>
            Hi, I’m <span style="color:#ff69b4; font-weight:600;">Alyaa</span>, a Diploma in Information Management student currently in my fifth semester.
            I have four siblings and I am the fourth child. I live in Kampung Padang Janggus, a peaceful village near a beautiful waterfall.
            I love cats and I consider myself an introvert — but once I feel comfortable, I can be the complete opposite!
        </p>

        <p>
            I enjoy spending my alone time watching my favourite series, <b>The Rookie</b>. I love English songs, and sometimes a few Malay songs too.
            My favourite subject has always been <b>English</b> because it feels natural and exciting to learn.
        </p>

        <p>
            When it comes to assignments, I strangely work best under pressure. 
            My brain becomes more creative when deadlines are close — not the best habit, but it works for me!
        </p>

        <p>
            Lastly, I want to express my gratitude to everyone who has supported me throughout this roller coaster academic journey,
            especially <span style="color:#ff69b4; font-weight:600;">ALLAH</span> for His guidance and blessings.
        </p>
